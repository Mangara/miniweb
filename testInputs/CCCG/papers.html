                <li> <span class="title">On the Shortest Separating Cycle</span> <span class="authors"><a href="http://www.cs.uwm.edu/faculty/ad/">Adrian Dumitrescu</a>.</span> <div class="abstract tex2jax_ignore"><p>According to a result of Arkin et al. (2016), given $n$ point pairs in the plane, 
                there exists a simple polygonal cycle that separates the two points in each pair 
                to different sides; moreover, a $O(\sqrt{n})$-factor approximation 
                with respect to the minimum length can be computed in polynomial time. 
                Here we extend the problem to geometric hypergraphs, 
                and obtain the following characterization of feasibility. 
                Given a geometric hypergraph on points in the plane with hyperedges of size at least $2$, 
                there exists a simple polygonal cycle that separates each hyperedge if and only if the 
                hypergraph is $2$-colorable.</p>

                <p>We extend the $O(\sqrt{n})$-factor approximation in the length measure as follows: 
                Given a geometric graph $G=(V,E)$, a separating cycle (if it exists) can be computed 
                in $O(m+n)$ time, where $|V|=n$, $|E|=m$. 
                Moreover, a $O(\sqrt{n})$-approximation of the shortest separating cycle can be found 
                in polynomial time. 
                Given a geometric graph $G=(V,E)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$, a separating polyhedron (if it exists) 
                can be found in $O(m+n)$ time, where $|V|=n$, $|E|=m$. 
                Moreover, a $O(n^{2/3})$-approximation of a separating polyhedron of minimum perimeter 
                can be found in polynomial time.</p></div>
                
                <li> <span class="title">Bottleneck Bichromatic Full Steiner Trees</span> <span class="authors"><span><a href="http://www.sce.ac.il/wp/abuaa1/">A. Karim Abu-Affash</a>, Sujoy Bhore, <a href="http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~carmip/">Paz Carmi</a> and Dibyayan Chakraborty</span>.</span>  <div class="abstract tex2jax_ignore"><p>Given two sets of points in the plane, Q of n (terminal) points and S of m (Steiner) points, where each of Q and S contains bichromatic points (red and blue points), a full bichromatic Steiner tree is a Steiner tree in which all points of Q are leaves 
                and each edge of the tree is bichromatic (i.e., connects a red and a blue point). 
                In the bottleneck bichromatic full Steiner tree (BBFST) problem, the goal is to compute a bichromatic full Steiner tree T, such that the length of the longest edge in T is minimized. In k-BBFST problem, the goal is to find a bichromatic full Steiner tree T with at most $k\le m$ Steiner points from S, such that the length of the longest edge in T is minimized. 
                In this paper, we present an $O((n+m)\log^2 m)$ time algorithm that solves the BBFST problem. Moreover, we show that k-BBFST problem is NP-hard and we give a polynomial-time 9-approximation algorithm for the problem.</p></div>

                8-grid (i.e., horizontal, vertical, diagonal) or some subset thereof. We give an algorithm that creates such drawings of width $O(\log^2 n)$, while the previous best result were drawings of width $O(n^{0.48})$. If only some of the grid-lines are allowed to be used, then the algorithm gives (with minor modifications) the same upper 
                bounds for the {/,|,\}-grid and the {|,\,—}-grid. On the other hand, in the {/,\,— }-grid sometimes $\Omega(\sqrt{n/\log n})$ width is required.</p></div>
                
                <li> <span class="title">Rep-cubes: Unfolding and Dissection of Cubes</span> <span class="authors"><span>Dawei Xu, Takashi Horiyama and Ryuhei Uehara</span>.</span>  <div class="abstract tex2jax_ignore"><p>Last year, a new notion of rep-cube was proposed. A rep-cube is a polyomino that is a net of a cube, and it can be divided into some polyominoes such that each of them can be folded to a cube. This notion was inspired by the notions of polyomino and rep-tile, which were introduced by Solomon W. Golomb. It is proved that there are infinitely many distinct rep-cubes. In this paper, we investigate this new notion and obtain three new results. First, we prove that there does not exist a regular rep-cube of order 3, which solves an open question proposed in the paper. Next, we enumerate all regular rep-cubes of order 2 and 4. For example, there are 33 rep-cubes of order 2; that is, there are 33 dodecominoes that can fold to a cube of size √2 ×√2 ×√2 and each of them can be divided into two nets of unit cube. Similarly, there are 7185 rep-cubes of order 4. 
                Lastly, we focus on pythagorean triples that consist of three positive integers (a, b, c) with a² + b² = c². For each of these triples, we can consider a rep-cube problem that asks whether a net of a cube of size c×c×c can be divided into two nets of two cubes of size a × a × a and b × b × b. We give a partial answer to this natural open question by dividing into more than two pieces. For any given pythagorean triple (a, b, c), we construct five polyominoes that form a net of a cube of size c×c×c and two nets of two cubes of size a×a×a and b×b×b.</p></div>
                
                <li> <span class="title">A General Algorithm for the Maximum Span of Fixed-Angle Chains</span> <span class="authors"><span>David Goering and Ronald Gentle</span>.</span>  <div class="abstract tex2jax_ignore"><p>Fixed angle chains have been used to model protein backbones and other molecular structures. Benbernou and O'Rourke proved several structural theorems for finding the maximum 3D span of fixed-angle chains: the largest distance achievable between the two endpoints. They used their results to develop an algorithm which can find the maximum span of chains with all angles equal to 90 degrees in quadratic time. We use their most general structural theorem to develop a new algorithm that computes the maximum span for any fixed-angle chain and the configuration in which this is achieved. The construction is purely geometric in nature, meaning that it consists of only straight-edge and compass constructions together with some list-keeping. It can be implemented with or without the use of a coordinate system. The algorithm has complexity $O(n^2)$ for any chains with equal fixed angles but arbitrary link lengths (alpha-chains). We do not claim that it runs in polynomial time for all chains but discuss why it will do so for those likely to be used in any modeling application.</p></div>

In this paper, we study all these guarding models in the special case of orthogonal polygons that have bounded treewidth in some sense. Exploiting algorithms for graphs of bounded treewidth, we show that the problem of finding the minimum number of guards in these models becomes linear-time solvable in polygons of bounded treewidth. </p></div>

You want to do this fairly, meaning that you and your friend should get the same amount of each ingredient. How many times do you need to cut the pizza so that this is possible? We will show that two straight cuts always suffice. More formally, we will show the following extension of the well-known Ham-Sandwich theorem: Given four mass distributions in the plane, they can be simultaneously bisected with two lines. That is, there exist two oriented lines with the following property: let $R^+_1$ be the region of the plane that lies to the positive side of both lines and let $R^+_2$ be the region of the plane that lies to the negative side of both lines. Then $R^+=R^+_1\cup R^+_2$ contains exactly half of each mass distribution. Additionally, we prove that five mass distributions in $\mathbb{R}^3$ can be simultaneously bisected by two planes.</p></div>

Nilsson</a> and Eli Packer</span>.</span>  <div class="abstract tex2jax_ignore"><p>The shortest watchman route of a polygon is the shortest closed tour that sees all points of an environment. A reasonable extension of this concept is to require that the tour minimizes the hiding time of the points in the environment, i.e., the maximum time during which any points is not seen by the agent following the tour at unit speed. We call such tours <em>surveillance routes</em>. It is known that the shortest watchman route is a 2-approximation for the best surveillance route in any simple polygon and any metric and that computing the optimum weighted discrete version of the surveillance route in a simple polygon is NP-hard, even for two weight values.</p>

                <p>We show a linear time $3/2$-approximation algorithm for the optimum surveillance tour problem in rectilinear polygons using the $L_1$ metric. In addition, we present a $w_{\max}^{\frac{O(1)}{\sqrt{\log w_{\max}}}}$-approximation algorithm for the optimum weighted discrete surveillance route in a simple polygon with weight values in the range $[1,w_{\max}]$. We observe that the above complexity function grows asymptotically slower than any function $O(\sqrt[k]{w_{\max}})$, for any constant $k$.</p></div>

In this paper, we study balanced $k$-center cluster where the size of each cluster is constrained by the given lower and upper bounds. The problem is motivated by the applications in processing and analyzing large-scale data in high dimension. We provide a simple nearly linear time $4$-approximation algorithm when the number of clusters $k$ is assumed to be a constant. Comparing with existing method, our algorithm improves the approximation ratio and significantly reduces the time complexity. Moreover, our result can be easily extended to any metric space. </p></div>

                every two vertices in a non-obtuse triangulation of a point set 
                are connected by an angle-monotone path&mdash;an xy-monotone path 
                in an appropriately rotated coordinate system. We show that this result cannot be 
                extended to angle-monotone spanning trees, but can be extended to 
                boundary-rooted spanning forests. The latter leads to

The goal is to find a set of disjoint axis-aligned rectangles in $Q$ such that each rectangle is anchored at some point in $P$, each point in $P$ is used to anchor at most one rectangle, and the total area of the rectangles is maximized. We show how to solve this problem in linear-time in the number of points of $P$, provided that the points of $P$ are given in sorted order along the boundary of $Q$. The solvability of the general version of this problem, in which the points of $P$ can also lie in the interior of $Q$, in polynomial-time, is still open.</p></div>

A beacon is a device that attracts objects toward itself within a given domain. A beacon $b$ covers a point if when a beacon attracts it, it reaches $b$. In this paper, we prove that there exist orthogonal polyhedra that cannot be covered even if we place a beacon at each of its vertices. We also give another example for covering the exterior of an orthogonal polyhedra. 
                We also study the beacon coverage problem in orthogonal polyhedra, by extending the notion of vertex beacons to edge beacons. We prove that $e/12$ edge beacons 
                are always sufficecient while $e/21$ edge beacons are sometimes necessary to cover any orthogonal polyhedron. We also prove that $e/6$ edge beacons are always sufficient to cover both the interior and the exterior of any orthogonal polyhedra. </p></div>

We study the computational problem of, given a target shape represented by a polygonal domain of $n$ vertices, is it possible to create it as one of the tools' shape via a sequence of snip operations? If so, how many snip operations are required? We show that a polynomial number of snips suffice for two different variants of the problem.</p></div>

We show a family of topological plane graphs such that any augmentation leaves at least $2n/5$ vertices without meeting their parity constraints, and a family of geometric plane trees such that any augmentation leaves at least $n/10$ vertices without meeting their parity constraints. We prove that the problem of adding a minimum number of edges to plane geometric graphs is NP-Complete. When the input graph is a topological tree finding a minimum set of edges that needed to be added to meet a parity constrain is solvable in $O(n)$ time and $O(1)$ space. We also establish a lower bound of $11n/15$ on the number of necessary edges to augment a topological graph when the graph is augmentable, and a lower bound of $6n/11$ on the number of necessary edges to augment a geometric tree when the tree is also augmentable.</p></div>

The definition extends to polygonal regions (polygons with holes) and to triangulations - for every face, the clockwise cyclic order of vertices on the boundary must be the same. It is known that every pair of compatible $n$-vertex polygonal regions can be extended to compatible triangulations by adding $O(n^2)$ Steiner points. Furthermore, $\Omega(n^2)$ Steiner points are sometimes necessary, even for a pair of polygons. Compatible triangulations provide piecewise linear homeomorphisms and are also a crucial first step in morphing planar graph drawings, aka "2D shape animation". An intriguing open question, first posed by Aronov, Seidel, and Souvaine in 1993, is to decide if two compatible polygons have compatible triangulations with at most $k$ Steiner points. In this paper we prove the problem to be NP-hard for polygons with holes. The question remains open for simple polygons.</p></div>

An imaging sensor is assigned to collect data over a large area, but some subregions are more valuable than others. To capture these high-value regions with higher fidelity, we can assign some number of non-overlapping rectangular subsets, called “subfootprints.” 
                The sensor image is partitioned into squares called “chips”, and each chip is further partitioned into pixels. Pixels may have different values. Subfootprints are restricted to rectangular collections of chips, but we are free to choose different rectangle heights, widths, and areas. We seek the optimal arrangement over the family of possible rectangle shapes and sizes.</p>

                <p>We provide a mixed-integer linear program optimization formulation, as well as a greedy heuristic, to solve this problem. For the meta-problem, we have some freedom to align the chip boundaries to different pixels. However, it is too expensive to solve the optimization formulation for each alignment.
                However, we show that the greedy heuristic can inform which pixel alignments are worth solving the optimization over. We use a variant of $k$-means clustering to group greedy solutions by their transport shape-similarity. For each cluster, we run the optimization problem over the greedy layout with the highest value. In practice this efficiently explores the geometric configuration space,
                and produces solutions close to the global optimum. We show a contrived example using surveillance of the Mississippi River. Our software is available as open-source in the Github repository “GeoPlace.”</p></div>

A path P in Γ is called increasing-chord if for every four points (not necessarily vertices) a, b, c, d on P in this order, the Euclidean distance between b, c is at most the Euclidean distance between a, d. A spanning tree T rooted at some vertex r in Γ is called increasing chord if T contains an increasing-chord path from r to every vertex in T. We prove that given a vertex r in a straight-line drawing Γ, it is NP-complete to decide whether Γ contains an increasing-chord spanning tree rooted at r, which answers a question posed by Mastakas and Symvonis. We also shed light on the problem of finding an increasing-chord path between a pair of vertices in Γ, but the computational complexity question remains open.</p></div>

We consider the computational problem of finding the smallest such integer for a given hypergraph, and show that it is NP-hard to approximate it to within $\log m$ where $m=\cardin{\edgesA}$. For most geometric hypergraphs, i.e., those defined on a set of $n$ points by intersecting it with some shapes, it is well known that there is a coloring with $2$ colors ‘red’ and ‘blue’ such that any hyperedge containing $c \log n$ points, for some constant $c$, is bi-chromatic, i.e., contains points of both colors. We observe that indeed, for several such hypergraph families, this is the best possible &ndash; i.e., there are some $n$ points where there will always be a hyperedge with $\Omega(\log n)$ points that is mono-chromatic. These results follow from results on the indecomposability of coverings. We also show that a well known hypergraph, used in the literature on indecomposable coverings <em>cannot</em> be realized by axis-parallel rectangles in the plane. This problem was mentioned in a paper of Pach. et. al. on indecomposable coverings.</p></div>

Given a graph $G$ and a set $S \subseteq V(G)$, a vertex $v$ is said to be <em>monitored</em> if either $v$ is a neighbor of $S$, or there is a vertex $u \in N(v)$ such that $v$ is the only non-monitored neighbor of $u$. The <em>power domination number</em> of a graph is then minimum size of a set $S$ such that this process monitors every vertex of the graph.
                We here show that the power domination number of a triangular grid $T_k$ with hexagonal-shape border of length $k-1$ is exactly $\big\lceil \dfrac{k}{3} \big\rceil$.</p></div>

Our goal is to locate a circle center $o∗$ such that the maximum distance of all points in $S$ to $o∗$ divided by the distance from $o∗$ to $b$ is minimized. The original investigation by Qiu et al. found an $O(n \log n)$ algorithm using the furthest point Voronoi diagram of the point set $S$. Our approach is based on Meggido’s $O(n)$ algorithm for solving the standard problem minimum enclosing circle. We extend our technique to solve in linear time similar variants of the MEC problem where the free point is replaced with other geometric objects such as a free line, a free line segment, and a set of free points.</p></div>

The spherical depth $\SphD(q;S)$ (<em>lens depth</em> $\LD(q;S)$) is also defined for an arbitrary data set $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ and $q\in \mathbb{R}^d$. This definition is based on counting all of the closed hyperballs (hyperlenses), obtained from pairs of points in $S$, that contain $q$. The straightforward algorithm for computing the spherical depth (lens depth) in dimension $d$ takes $O(dn^2)$. The main result of this paper is an optimal algorithm for computing the bivariate spherical depth. The algorithm takes $O(n \log n)$ time. By reducing the problem of \textit{Element Uniqueness}, we prove that computing the spherical depth (lens depth) requires $\Omega(n \log n)$ time. Some geometric properties of spherical depth (lens depth) are also investigated in this paper. These properties indicate that <em>simplicial depth</em> ($\SD$) is linearly bounded by spherical depth and lens depth (in particular, $\LD\geq \SphD\geq \frac{2}{3}SD$). To illustrate these relationships, some experimental results are provided. In these experiments on random point sets, the bounds of $\SphD\geq 2\SD$ and $\LD \geq 1.2\SphD$ are achieved.</p></div>

The standard versions of these problems are defined as follows: we are given a set $S$ of $n$ segments in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and we would like to preprocess $S$ so that we can quickly answer queries of the form: is the given query segment $s \in S$ visible from the given query point $q \in \mathbb{R}^2$ (for visibility testing) and how many segments in $S$ are visible from the given query point $q \in \mathbb{R}^2$ (for visibility counting).</p>

                <p>In our model of uncertainty, each segment may or may not exist, and if it does, it is located in one of finitely many possible locations, given by a discrete probability distribution. In this setting, the probabilistic visibility testing problem (PVTP, for short) is to compute the probability that a given segment $s \in S$ is visible from a given query point $q$ and the probabilistic visibility counting problem (PVCP, for short) is to compute the expected number of segments in $S$ that are visible from a query point $q$. 
                We first show that PVTP is $\#P$-complete. In the special case where uncertainty is only about whether segments exist and not about their location, we show that the problem is solvable in $O(n\log n)$ time. Using this, together with a few old tricks, we can show that one can preprocess $S$ in $O(n^5\log n)$ time into a data structure of size $O(n^4)$ so that PVTP queries can be answered in $O(\log n)$ time. Our algorithm for PVTP combined with linearity of expectation gives an $O(n^2\log n)$ time algorithm for PVCP. We also give a faster 2-approximation algorithm for this problem. </p></div>
