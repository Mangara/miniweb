- A good reference for when omitting quotes on attributes is okay:

https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/unquoted-attribute-values

"A valid unquoted attribute value in HTML is any string of text that is not the empty string and that doesnâ€™t contain spaces, tabs, line feeds, form feeds, carriage returns, ", ', `, =, <, or >."

Regex (mine): [^ \t\n\r\f"'`=<>]+

- Encoding class names and ids:

Syntax: [a-z][a-z0-9_-]

Huffman makes an optimal *prefix-free* encoding. We don't care about that, so we can just assign the shortest code to the most frequent class, and so on.
